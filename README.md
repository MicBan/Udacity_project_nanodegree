## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. For completness, list libraries used in the project is listed below:
- sklearn
- keras
- numpy
- pandas
- glob
- cv2
- random
- matplotlib

Due to size restrictions there is missing a file DogVGG16Data.npz which should be normally found in the bottleneck_features folder. Also note that only a sample of available data has been uploaded on Github due to storage limitations.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

My main motivation behind this project is concerning development of skills in regards to neural networks and deep learning. Specifically, here I try to learn the following:

1. How to create a CNN from scratch?
2. How to apply transfer learning?
3. How change of parameters impacts accuracy of predictions?
